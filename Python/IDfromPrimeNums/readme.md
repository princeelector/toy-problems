# ID from string of prime numbers

Given a random number from **0** to **10000** return a new string from a prime_numbers_str ("2357111317192329..."). The new string's starting index should be equal to **i** in **solution(i)** and the string itself should have 5 characters. So if "3" is passed as a method's argument, the returned string will be "71113". The value of **i** will always be between 0 and 10000.
