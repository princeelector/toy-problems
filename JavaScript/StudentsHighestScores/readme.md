# Students High Scores

## Description

You have an array of objects representing students test scores.
Each result has an id value representing a student, and the score value of a given test.
Log to the console the highest score of each student, the 5 highest scores they
managed to receive from lowest to highest and their average score out of the 5 top scores.
