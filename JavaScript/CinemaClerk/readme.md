# Cinema Clerk

The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at
the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50
or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Jacob is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single
person in this line.

Can Jacob sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no
money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?
