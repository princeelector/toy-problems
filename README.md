# Programming Toy Problems

Toy problems are software engineering challenges that aim to create solutions that apply desired results.
Although not as complex as engineering problems in real projects, toy problems are a good way to practice
the creation of efficient algorithms and to boost one's fluency with a given programming language.

## Info on the repository

This repository is a collection of **toy problems** applied in various languages, predominantly JavaScript.
Each problem's subdirectory includes description with the information on a solution to implement and at least
one expected result.

## Contributing

Possible enhancements to this repository include:

- Creating unit tests and test cases
- More detailed and clarified problem descriptions
- Adding more problems solved using other programming languages (preferably Python and C#)
